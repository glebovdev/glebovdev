### Ilya Glebov – @glebovdev
Hi. I'm Ilya – full-stack web developer and DevOps.  

My dev-path started very-very long time ago with C++ and ASP.  
Since then I mostly code with PHP. Projects I build run on Laravel.  
I completely migrated from monolith to microservices (Docker).  

Besides web-related technologies, I very passionate about Golang, Scala, Rust,
Kotlin, Erlang, Lua, Python and more DevOps-related techniques, like Ansible, Terraform and Kubernetes.

#### I also do:
- build things with Arduino  
- fly with my Mavic Air 2 drone (pics on my Instagram 👇🏼)
- play guitar from time to time
